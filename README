Pickle Warehouse
==================
Pickle Warehouse makes it easy to save Python
objects to files with meaningful identifiers.

How to use
-------------------
Pickle Warehouse provides a dictionary-like object
that is associated with a particular directory on
your computer. ::

    from pickle_warehouse import Warehouse
    warehouse = Warehouse('/tmp/a-directory')

The keys correspond to files, and the values get
pickled to the files. ::

    warehouse['filename'] = range(100)

    import pickle
    range(100) == pickle.load(open('/tmp/a-directory/filename', 'rb'))

You can also read and delete things. ::

    # Read
    range(100) == warehouse['filename']

    # Delete
    del(warehouse['filename'])

The coolest part is that the key gets interpreted
in a fancy way. Aside from strings and string-like objects,
you can use iterables of strings; all of these indices refer
to the file ``/tmp/a-directory/foo/bar/baz``::

    warehouse[('foo','bar','baz')]
    warehouse[['foo','bar','baz']]

If you pass a relative path to a file, it will be broken up as you'd expect;
that is, strings get split on slashes and backslashes. ::

    warehouse['foo/bar/baz']
    warehouse['foo\\bar\\baz']

Note well: Specifying an absolute path won't save things outside the warehouse directory. ::

    warehouse['/foo/bar/baz'] # -> foo, bar, baz
    warehouse['C:\\foo\\bar\\baz'] # -> c, foo, bar, baz
                                   # (lowercase "c")

If you pass a URL, it will also get broken up in a reasonable way. ::

    # /tmp/a-directory/http/thomaslevine.com/!/?foo=bar#baz
    warehouse['http://thomaslevine.com/!/?foo=bar#baz']

    # /tmp/a-directory/thomaslevine.com/!?foo=bar#baz
    warehouse['thomaslevine.com/!?foo=bar#baz']

Dates and datetimes get converted to :code:`YYYY-MM-DD` format. ::

    import datetime

    # /tmp/a-directory/2014-02-26
    warehouse[datetime.date(2014,2,26)]
    warehouse[datetime.datetime(2014,2,26,13,6,42)]

And you can mix these formats! ::

    # /tmp/a-directory/http/thomaslevine.com/open-data/2014-02-26
    warehouse[('http://thomaslevine.com/open-data', datetime.date(2014,2,26))]

It also has typical dictionary methods like :code:`keys`, :code:`values`, :code:`items`,
and :code:`update`.

When to use
----------------
pickle-warehouse is for when you want a persistant store of Python objects.
If you want an in-memory pickle store, look at
