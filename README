Pickle Warehouse
==================
``pickle-warehouse`` makes it easy to save Python
objects to files with meaningful identifiers.

How to use
-------------------
`pickle-warehouse` provides a dictionary-like object
that is associated with a particular directory on
your computer.

    from pickle_warehouse import Warehouse
    warehouse = Warehouse('/tmp/a-directory')

The keys correspond to files, and the values get
pickled to the files. ::

    warehouse['filename'] = range(100)

    import pickle
    range(100) == pickle.load(open('/tmp/a-directory/filename', 'rb'))

You can also read and delete things. ::

    # Read
    range(100) == warehouse['filename']

    # Delete
    del(warehouse['filename'])

The coolest part is that the key gets interpreted
in a fancy way. Aside from strings and string-like objects,
you can use iterables of strings; all of these indices refer
to the file ``/tmp/a-directory/foo/bar/baz``::

    warehouse[('foo','bar','baz')]
    warehouse[['foo','bar','baz']]

If you pass a URL, it will get broken up in a reasonable way. ::

    # /tmp/a-directory/http/thomaslevine.com/!/?foo=bar#baz
    warehouse['http://thomaslevine.com/!/?foo=bar#baz']

    # /tmp/a-directory/thomaslevine.com/!?foo=bar#baz
    warehouse['thomaslevine.com/!?foo=bar#baz']

Dates and datetimes get converted to ``YYYY-MM-DD`` format. ::

    import datetime

    # /tmp/a-directory/2014-02-26
    warehouse[datetime.date(2014,2,26)]
    warehouse[datetime.datetime(2014,2,26,13,6,42)]

And you can mix these formats! ::

    # /tmp/a-directory/http/thomaslevine.com/open-data/2014-02-26
    warehouse[('http://thomaslevine.com/open-data', datetime.date(2014,2,26))]

It also has typical dictionary methods like ``keys``, ``values``, ``items``,
and ``update``.

When to use
----------------
Use this when you want a persistant store of Python objects.
If you want an in-memory pickle store, look at
